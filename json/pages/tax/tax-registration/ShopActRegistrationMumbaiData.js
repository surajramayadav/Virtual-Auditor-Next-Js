                        Shop and Establishment Act Registration in India , Employees in the unorganised sector don’t have any other regulatory body to make sure that their rights and working conditions are as they ought to be. For this reason, the Shop and Establishment Act was enacted. The object of the Act is to oversee, govern and enhance the working conditions and protect the rights of the workers. The Shop and Establishment Act made compulsory for shops/establishments, wherein any business, trade, or profession is conducted, to obtain Shop Act License.
